            "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
            pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
            account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
            rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
            pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
            rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
            pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
            circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some
            great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever
            undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
            advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
            who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
            or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
            Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by
            Cicero in 45 BC "At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos
            ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque
            corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati
            cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia
            deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero
            tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit
            quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas
            assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam
            et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et
            voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque
            earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis
            voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus
            asperiores repellat." 1914 translation by H. Rackham "On the other
            hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are
            so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
            so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
            that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
            in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
            through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
            simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of
            choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to
            do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
            pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims
            of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that
            pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
            man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
            selection: he rejects p
